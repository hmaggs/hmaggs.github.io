    <p>My name is Hari, a nickname created by my parents when they realized that no one could pronounce my given Welsh name, Angharad. I grew up in San Diego, California and therefore have a never-dying passion for beaches, burritos, and being in the ocean. I have been lucky enough to be able to travel to the United Kingdom every year to visit my very large-in-numbers extended family, and during this time I try to visit other countries in Europe whenever I can. I spent a semester in Sydney, Australia during the Fall of 2014 where I hope to travel back to again soon.</p>
    <p>Through my travels, I have experienced many different cultures and been to some amazing locations. Having these experiences inspires me to be creative in my photography and diverse in my communication skills. I hope you enjoy my website and the photos I have collected through my travels.</p>
